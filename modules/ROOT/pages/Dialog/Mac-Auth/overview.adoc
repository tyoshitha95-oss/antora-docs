= Overview

The MAC Authentication System is a RADIUS-based network access control solution that authenticates devices using their MAC addresses instead of traditional username/password credentials. It is designed for ISP and enterprise environments where automated device-level authentication, quota enforcement, and policy control are required.

This system integrates with Huawei BNG and Cisco IWAG devices to enforce location-based access, time restrictions, session monitoring, and Fair Usage Policy (FUP). It ensures secure, controlled, and policy-driven network access while maintaining detailed accounting and logging mechanisms.

The platform is built with a modular architecture that supports scalability, centralized policy management, and real-time session validation.

== Key Objectives

* Automate device authentication
* Enforce data and time quotas
* Apply Fair Usage Policy dynamically
* Restrict access by location and time
* Provide detailed session tracking and monitoring

== Questions Discussed in This Documentation

This documentation answers the following key questions:

* How does MAC-based authentication work in a RADIUS environment?
* How are MAC addresses validated against the subscriber database?
* How does the system apply location-based access control?
* How are time restrictions enforced during authentication?
* How are volume and session time quotas calculated?
* When and how is Fair Usage Policy (FUP) applied?
* How does the accounting handler track active sessions?
* What log messages are generated during authentication?
* How can administrators monitor database usage and active sessions?
* What are the common failure scenarios and how are they handled?
